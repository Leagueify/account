# Account Service

The Leagueify account service is responsible for managing user authentication,
authorization, and profiles. The Leagueify account service uses 
[Go][go-download] using version `1.23.0`.

## Key Functions

- User registration and login.
- Password management and account recovery.
- Role-based access control for different user types.
    - admin, boardmember, coach, parent, etc

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Docker][docker-download] is installed and running.

### Getting Started

Local development of the Leagueify account service uses docker for a consistent
development environment. Running the Leagueify account service locally can be
accomplished using commands found in the [Makefile][repo-makefile]. During local
development changes will trigger a live reload, eliminating the requirement to
restart the docker image manually. This is accomplished by using the wonderful
tool [air][github-air]. The most common commands have been outlined below:

```bash
# start leagueify docker image
make start

# stop leagueify docker image removing attached volumes
make clean
```

The Leagueify account service is ready for development once the banner output is
visible within the terminal. By default the Leagueify account service api docs
are accessible at [http://localhost:6501/account/docs][service-url]. The banner
below was created using the
[Text to ASCII Art Generator by Patorjk][patorjk-taag].
